    ABOUT
  </p>

</body>
<p>
  We are a family owned restaurant that the locals love. We have
been around for thirty-five years, and we plan to stay for at
least thirty-five more. Tourists love our location on the Grand
Canal because they can sit and look out onto the water. The
view during a sunset is incredible and hard to miss out on.

  Our chef, Adrian Hassan, is a dedicated father of two, husband,
and worker. He loves to get creative with his new dishes and
his plating. He has studied the culinary arts all over the world,
but he specialized in Italian cuisine. He loves to go out and
communicate with the customers. He also loves to get
feedback from all the tourists and locals. He is always striving
to get better and to make the customers even happier every
time they visit us.
